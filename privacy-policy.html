                    our social media mobile app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your

                <p>

                    We collect information you provide when you create an account, such as your name, email address, and
                    password. We also collect information you provide when you use our app, such as the content you post

                </p>
                <p>

                    We may collect information about your device, including the type of device, operating system, and
                    mobile
                    network information. We may also collect location data if you give us permission to do so.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Use of information

                <p>

                    We use the information we collect to provide and improve our app and to personalize your experience.
                    We
                    may use your information to communicate with you, such as to notify you of new features or to

                    your support requests.
                </p>
                <p>

                    We may use your information for research and analytics purposes, such as to understand how users

                <p>

                    We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf,
                    such as hosting our app or processing payments. We may also share your information with advertisers
                    and
                    advertising networks to deliver and personalize ads.
                </p>

                <p>

                    We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or
                    subpoena,
                    or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the
                    safety
                    of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

                <p>

                    However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we
                    cannot
